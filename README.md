# Wrangling_Plotting_Model_Testing_Using_R
This project was conducted as part of a nano degree at Udacity. 
Because data visualization and data science is a passion, I decided to limit the time to invest in this project to 30 working hours. The data used in this project is called “Loan Data Form Prosper” and it was supplied with the project instructions. However, it is also available online (please see the references). In this project, I aimed at visualizing the different variable separately and against each other. The idea was to try to identify a pattern or a relationship between the different variables. I aimed to develop and test a model that helps to predict one of the important variables (from my point of view). Eventually, I was successful in developing a simple 5 variable model that predicts the yield on loans quite successfully.
